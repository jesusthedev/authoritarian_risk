    <h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Fascism — Clean Breakdown</h1>
    <p class="text-zinc-300">Fascism is basically the political equivalent of duct tape and rage—it tries to hold a whole society together with force, fear, and a lot of shouting about “unity,” while secretly serving a small clique at the top.</p>
    <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold">Definition</h2>
    <p class="text-zinc-300"><b>Fascism:</b> A far-right, authoritarian ultranationalist political system characterized by dictatorial power, suppression of dissent, strong regimentation of society and the economy, and glorification of the state (often embodied in a single leader).</p>
    <p class="text-zinc-300">It thrives on myth-making: “the nation is under attack,” “the leader is the savior,” “the minority is the threat.” The key vibe is control + conformity + violence wrapped in patriotic branding.</p>
    <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold">Core Features (Bullet Breakdown)</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-zinc-300">
      <li><b>Authoritarian leadership</b>: Power concentrated in one leader (the “strongman”) with cult-like following.</li>
      <li><b>Nationalism on steroids</b>: Glorification of the homeland, traditions, and symbols.</li>
      <li><b>Militarism</b>: Obsession with strength, war, and discipline as virtues.</li>
      <li><b>Suppression of opposition</b>: Censorship, imprisonment, and even elimination of political opponents.</li>
      <li><b>Scapegoating</b>: Blaming minorities, immigrants, or other groups for national problems.</li>
      <li><b>Corporatism</b>: State alignment with big business, often crushing labor rights while pretending it’s all “for the nation.”</li>
      <li><b>Propaganda</b>: Constant use of media, rallies, and symbols to brainwash loyalty.</li>
      <li><b>Anti-democratic</b>: Rejection of pluralism, elections as theater, and rule of law bent to the leader’s will.</li>
      <li><b>Cult of tradition</b>: Romanticizing a “pure” mythical past to justify present brutality.</li>
      <li><b>Emotional manipulation</b>: Fear, anger, and pride weaponized to keep the masses obedient.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold">Historical Examples</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-zinc-300">
      <li><b>Benito Mussolini (Italy, 1922–1943)</b>: Invented the term “fascism.” Blackshirts, marches, and brutal crackdown on opposition. Myth of a reborn Roman Empire.</li>
      <li><b>Adolf Hitler (Germany, 1933–1945)</b>: Nazi fascism + racial supremacy ideology; extreme anti-Semitism, genocide, total war economy; blended nationalism, propaganda, and terror.</li>
      <li><b>Francisco Franco (Spain, 1939–1975)</b>: Dictatorship after civil war, nationalist and authoritarian; Catholicism fused with state ideology; suppression of regional identities.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold">Modern Indicators (When the smell lingers)</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-zinc-300">
      <li>Leaders claiming “only I can fix it.”</li>
      <li>Media branded “enemy of the people.”</li>
      <li>National symbols and slogans everywhere, used to demand conformity.</li>
      <li>Dissent treated as betrayal instead of democracy.</li>
      <li>Marginalized groups painted as “existential threats.”</li>
    </ul>
